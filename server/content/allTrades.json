  "intro": "CREATIVE GENERALIST",
  "paragraph1": "Hi, I'm Ishraqur Rahman, the design-obsessed marketer behind Irreal Visuals. After graduating with a degree in marketing, I started my career at a young digital marketing agency where I learned the ropes of the trade. I eventually decided to go on my own way, with the aim of placing a greater emphasis on creativity and design to improve the visual appearance of client communications. This vision gave rise to \"Irreal Visuals\".",
  "paragraph2": "Although Irreal Visuals began as a one-man operation, it has evolved to a fully remote team of employees and freelance partners. Operating remotely has allowed us to be cost-effective, enabling us to pass these savings on to our clients.",
  "paragraph3": "I have also recently started my journey as a digital content creator to gain a better understanding of popular social media platforms, with an aim to better serve our clients."
